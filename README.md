system crash is my System Crash Helper Repository. This will (hopefully) bring me back to the stage before next system d-day'll happen. I start this repositroy because of personal experiences -- me getting foolsih again. I know me very well. It will happen. Promise. So keep your fingers crossed for me having proper documentations. This is my first step in the right direction.  # dotelse
